Recursively processes lines of code from a vector based on trailing space difference.

The logic compares the trailing spaces of the current line to the previous line.
An increase in trailing spaces (assumed 2 spaces per level) is converted into
leading opening parentheses. The first '/' is replaced with a ')'.
